Choose if the featured image should be displayed in the single post/page view or not. This plugin doesn't affect the archives view.

== Description ==
= Important notice =
If your theme does a customized call to load the featured image (like the Twenty Seventeen theme), this plugin might not work! Use `get_the_post_thumbnail()` or `wp_get_attachment_image()` to be sure it will work.

= Description =
This plugin lets you choose for each post or page, if the featured image should be shown in the single view. This can get handy, if you use the featured image to show a thumbnail on the archives or front page but you don't want the featured image to be shown on every posts view itself.

The plugin adds a simple checkbox to the featured image panel (or meta box if you are using the classic editor), that lets you choose, if the featured image will be shown in the singular view or not.

== Frequently asked questions ==
= The plugin doesn't work with my theme. What can I do? =
Either

*   kindly ask the theme developer to use one of the dedicated WordPress functions (`wp_get_attachment_image()`, `get_the_post_thumbnail()`, `the_post_thumbnail()`) to load the featured image in the singular views.
*   or create a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/) that replaces the call, that loads the featured image, with one of the methods listed above.

= Can I hide featured images by default? =
Yes. Just add the following line to your functions.php:
`
add_filter('cybocfi_hide_by_default', '__return_true');
`
All *new* posts and pages will now hide the featured image by default (checkbox is checked by default). Existing posts and pages won't be changed.

You may also set different default values depending on the post type:
`
function cybocfi_set_default_hiding_state( $default, $post_type ) {
    if ( 'post' === $post_type ) {
        $default = true; // set the default state for posts
    } else if ( 'page' === $post_type ) {
        $default = false; // set the default state for pages
    }

    return $default;
}
add_filter( 'cybocfi_hide_by_default', 'cybocfi_set_default_hiding_state', 10, 2 );
`

= Can I limit this plugin to posts (and exclude other post types)? =
Yes. By default, the plugin is available on any post type, that has a featured image. But there is a filter, that lets you control, for with post types the plugin should be available. The following example limits it to posts only:
`
function cybocfi_enable_by_post_type( $post_type ) {
    return 'post' === $post_type;
}
add_filter( 'cybocfi_post_type', 'cybocfi_enable_by_post_type' );
`
The filter provides you the current post type and you can decide if you want to use the plugin for this post type by returning `true` to enable and `false` to disable it. Add the following snippet to your `functions.php` to enable the plugin for posts and pages, but disable it for any other post type:
`
function cybocfi_enable_by_post_type( $post_type ) {
    $allowed_post_types = array( 'post', 'page' ); // add any post type you want to use the plugin with
    return in_array( $post_type, $allowed_post_types );
}
add_filter( 'cybocfi_post_type', 'cybocfi_enable_by_post_type' );
`

= Is it possible to get the plugin in my language? =
Absolutely. You're invited to [contribute a translation](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/conditionally-display-featured-image-on-singular-pages/) in your language. Please keep in mind, that the translation needs to be reviewed by the community, so it will take a little while until it gets accepted.

= How can I change the text of the checkbox? =
There is a filter hook for this. Add the following snippet to your functions.php:
`
function cybocfi_set_featured_image_label( $label ) {
    return 'Hide featured image in post'; // change this string
}
add_filter( 'cibocfi_checkbox_label', 'cybocfi_set_featured_image_label' );
`
